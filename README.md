Computer Simulation- Object-oriented Programming
These are courseworks submitted for Computer Simulation Year 2 University of Edinburgh. 25/25 (100%) attained in coursework.
1) Checkpoint 1: Polynomial equations and data visualization; basic handling of floating point numbers and mathematical functions.
2) Checkpoint 2: Simulation of radioactive decay of atomic particles 
3) Checkpoint 3: Mandelbrot Set;  to plot out a graph of amplitude against time for a damped harmonic oscillator.
4) Checkpoint 4: Traffic Motion: to read in data from a text file, process the data and plot the output.
5) Checkpoint 5: Orbital Motion: calcuate path and enegy of projectile under drag.

Objectives of Computer Simulation Course:
1) Understand the motivation for computing, understand the basics of Linux, be able to use the command line, emacs editor and execute Python scripts.
2) Understand variables and how operators perform basic arithmetic.
3) Understand how to read and write from/to a terminal window and write a basic Python programme.
4) Understand how to import additional libraries including math, cmath and random.
5) Understand conditional statments and indentation rules and write programs using these.
6) Understand list and loop constructs.
7) Understand and be able to use the matplotlib library to produce simple static graphs of data.
8) Understand basic text-based file input and output and be able to write simple programs to read data and produce graphs.
9) Understand the use of functions as a way to organise code and be able to write programs using these.
10) Be aware of more complex Python constructs, in particular elementary lists comprehension and basic OOP
