Computer Simulation- Object-oriented Programming
These are courseworks submitted for Computer Simulation. 25/25 (100%) attained in coursework 
1) Checkpoint 1: Polynomial equations and data visualization; basic handling of floating point numbers and mathematical functions.
2) Checkpoint 2: Simulation of radioactive decay of atomic particles 
3) Checkpoint 3: Mandelbrot Set;  to plot out a graph of amplitude against time for a damped harmonic oscillator.
4) Checkpoint 4: Traffic Motion: to read in data from a text file, process the data and plot the output.
5) Checkpoint 5: Orbital Motion: calcuate path and enegy of projectile under drag.

Objectives of Computer Simulation Course:
-Understand the motivation for computing, understand the basics of Linux, be able to use the command line, emacs editor and execute Python scripts.
-Understand variables and how operators perform basic arithmetic.
-Understand how to read and write from/to a terminal window and write a basic Python programme.
-Understand how to import additional libraries including math, cmath and random.
-Understand conditional statments and indentation rules and write programs using these.
-Understand list and loop constructs.
-Understand and be able to use the matplotlib library to produce simple static graphs of data.
-Understand basic text-based file input and output and be able to write simple programs to read data and produce graphs.
-Understand the use of functions as a way to organise code and be able to write programs using these.
-Be aware of more complex Python constructs, in particular elementary lists comprehension and basic OOP
